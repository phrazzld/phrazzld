# Phaedrus Raznikov

I build things with AI and ship them.

Solo founder at [Misty Step](https://mistystep.io). Running a fleet of AI agents to build, ship, and maintain a portfolio of products. One engineer, no employees — the bet is that the right tools make headcount irrelevant.

### Developer Tools

- **[thinktank](https://github.com/phrazzld/thinktank)** — Multi-LLM synthesis CLI. Query multiple models, get unified reasoning.
- **[moonbridge](https://github.com/misty-step/moonbridge)** — MCP bridge for delegating between AI CLIs.
- **[vox](https://github.com/misty-step/vox)** — Invisible macOS dictation. Hotkey → clean text, anywhere.
- **[ponder](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder)** — Fast note-taking CLI. Rust.
- **[glance](https://github.com/phrazzld/glance)** — Autogen directory summaries. Go.

### Products

- **[Chrondle](https://chrondle.com)** — Daily history guessing game. Guess the year in six tries.
- **[Time is Money](https://github.com/phrazzld/timeismoney)** — Chrome extension. Prices as hours of work.
- **[Bitcoin Price Tag](https://github.com/phrazzld/bitcoin-price-tag)** — Chrome extension. Fiat prices in sats.

### The Factory

Building autonomous infrastructure — agents that monitor, review, and ship code:

- **[bitterblossom](https://github.com/misty-step/bitterblossom)** — Declarative agent fleet provisioning on Fly.io.
- **[cerberus](https://github.com/misty-step/cerberus)** — Multi-agent AI code review council.
- **[factory](https://github.com/misty-step/factory)** — Agent control plane and dashboard.
